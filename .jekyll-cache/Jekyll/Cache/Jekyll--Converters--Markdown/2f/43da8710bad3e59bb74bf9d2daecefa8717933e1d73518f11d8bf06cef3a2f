I"k<p>Over the course of 2019, I built and deployed two Instagram bots, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/wikipictureoftheday/">@wikipictureoftheday</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/wacky_minions/">@wacky_minions</a>. @wikipictureoftheday had a relatively simple concept: Pull the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Picture_of_the_day">Wikipedia picture of the day</a> and post it to Instagram at regular intervals. It ended up making a pretty compelling feed, with plenty of interesting facts and photography, but never took off in popularity.</p>
