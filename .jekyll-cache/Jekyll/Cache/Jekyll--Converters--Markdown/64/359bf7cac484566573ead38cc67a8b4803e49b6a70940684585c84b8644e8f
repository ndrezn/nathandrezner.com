I"<p>To help identify and analyze the themes, tropes, and structure of horror, I created a set of graphs representing the social networks of various films and used network analysis to help clarify the role of the female gothic in social structure and identify the relationship between theatricality and role-playing in the horror genre.</p>

<p>The source code, as well as a brief essay on my findings from the project, is available <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ndrezn/horror-social-networks">here</a>.</p>
