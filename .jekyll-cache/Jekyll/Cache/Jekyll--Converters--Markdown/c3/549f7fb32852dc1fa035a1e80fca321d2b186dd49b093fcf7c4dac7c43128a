I"µ<p>I organize and curate an art and design collective in Montreal called <i>secretgroup</i>, based around a series of spontaneous events and art spaces. More information on the collective, and the events we host, is available on our website at <a target="_blank" href="https://secretgroup.xyz">secretgroup.xyz</a>.</p>

<p>This project started out as a loose idea in Fall 2017. I spent a late night up with Katrina Ocampo building a website up from scratch, with little more than a URL to work off of: secretgroup.xyz. Although I retained the website, technical issues meant it faded into the background.</p>

<div class="image-line2">

</div>
<p><small style="text-align:center; margin: 0 auto;">Stickers were scattered everywhere, from street posts to caf√© bathrooms.</small></p>

<p>Two years later, I picked up the concept again, this time compelled to turn the project into something material. The concept was simple. Populate Montr√©al with stickers labelled only with a URL, which leads to a website with an invitation offering only an unmarked address and a date. Would it work? Who would show?</p>
