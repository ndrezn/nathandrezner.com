title: Melted bicycles
---

I'm obsessed with abandoned bikes. Here in Montr√©al, the ice thaws in the Spring to reveal the litter of Fall bicycles, forgotten by their owners. Often, bikes are so badly bruised it's difficult to imagine their original shape. They'll eventually be taken away by the city, transported to the dump rather than being left to rot as streetside compost. Many feel as though they're slowly melting into the concrete, having completely forgotten the form of being a bicycle.

I've been taking photos of some of my favourites this spring, documenting them until their perpetual demise when they're carried off in the early summertime. It's fun to imagine their past lives, but to me they're more notable now as detritus than they possibly could have been when new.

I take good care of my own bike, I promise. Maybe you've passed by some of these -- if you haven't, try to walk past them and see if you recognize them. Most of these are within a few blocks around my apartment. Try documenting the remaining form of whatever melting bicycles you run into.

I can't collect broken bikes, but I can befriend them as I walk past, paying them a bit of attention as I go along my way. Maybe that'll compel them to stay out on the street just a bit longer, to give them incentive to talk the street cleaners out of ripping them away. There's still some attention worth giving them.
