title: NFTs and Wikipedia
---

In early December, I visited the Broad Museum during a visit to Los Angeles. It's a public museum that hosts the private collection of Eli and Edyth Broad, a billionare philanthropist couple who generated their wealth from the insurance business. They have on display there <i>Rabbit</i>, a notable Jeff Koons sculpture.

I talked for a bit to one of the security guards in the room with the sculpture, who mentioned off-hand that the sculpture had sold for more than $150 million. I took a look at the Wikipedia article on the most expensive sales: [List of most expensive artworks by living artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_artworks_by_living_artists). Turns out that <i>Rabbit</i> actually sold for $91.1 million. Huh.

Two sales on the list were by artists I didn't know -- both sales of NFTs which sold at around $70 and $90 million, both in 2021. I didn't recoginze either NFT creator, so I followed the breadcrumbs and read their respective Wikipedia articles. The article on [Pak (creator)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pak_(creator)>) read like marketing, and the sources for the sale on the list article were ambiguous. I took the item off of the list, cleaned up the Pak article a bit, and went on my way. I also opened up a conversation on the [talk page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_most_expensive_artworks_by_living_artists) for the article about the change I'd made, and where to go in general.

I love editing Wikipedia -- my editing patterns tend to come in spurts, as I get more or less involved in discussions on Wikipedia. In the past, I've been involved in conversations about [whether Stanley Kubrik's article should have an infobox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Stanley_Kubrick/Archive_10#Infobox_2) and why the England women's national football team article [has a gender modifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:England_national_football_team#Page_move) but the England men's national team doesn't.

It's frequent that people will be aggressive with Wikipedia policy in these discussions: In the latter, editors were accused of [using Wikipedia's primary topic policy to shield from androcentrism](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(idea_lab)/Archive_30#Idea_development_help_needed%3A_Preventing_WP%3APRIMARYTOPIC_from_being_used_as_a_shield_to_perpetuate_androcentrism>). I tend to agree with that description. Yet, policy and guidelines on Wikipedia, written by Wikipedians, are both significant and old. [By March 2007, over 80% of Wikipedia's existing policy pages had already been created.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.01725.pdf) Many of these policies are solid -- no original research, reliable sources, neutral point of view. Others are more frustrating to work around, and in general the breadth of policies can make it difficult for newcomers to become assimilated, especially to more heated and public conversations like the discussion around NFTs.

I opened a formal request for comment ([RfC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment)) to specifically ask whether NFTs should be included in the article. My comments rested on repeating my original edit summary -- few to no secondary sources and a lack of external consensus meant it was difficult to categorize NFTs among the other sales on the list. The editor [Pmmcurdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Pmmccurdy) — Patrick McCurdy, a professor in humanities at the University of Ottawa, who teaches on Wikipedia subject matter — joined the fray. In fact, McCurdy was the primary author of the article on Pak: Initially, he submitted the article twice, and it was deleted twice. The third submission was nominated for deletion, but [dozens of anonymous users](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pak_(creator)#Contested_deletion>) chimed in following the nomination, and the article was preserved. It's a really weird set of comments to read through. McCurdy represented the only consistent voice in support of including NFTs — seeming to take it personally that Pak's NFT wasn't included in the article. (Murat Pak? Patrick McCurdy? You picking up what I'm putting down? My conspiracy of the day.)

The RfC picked up the attention of [several](https://observer.com/2022/01/editors-on-wikipedia-dont-believe-nfts-count-as-art/) [press](https://qz.com/2113524/are-nfts-art-wikipedia-says-not-exactly/) [outlets](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/wikipedia-editors-vote-no-on-nft-art-definition-180979405/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/muratpak/status/1476671204115288067). The debate was suddenly around the question, "Are NFTs art?" (Maybe, who cares, who knows, in my opinion.) The artist in question, Pak, started tweeting about me. Which was weird. Imagine if Jeff Koons was complaining about his coverage in Encylopaedia Britannica. Folks from NFT Twitter started hanging out in my replies and heckling me for drinking tap water (???) and gobbling their Wikipedia donations (???).

As of time of publishing, both NFTs have been removed from the list (I didn't do this, and actually I proposed a different solution). Maybe they'll be added back, maybe they won't; luckily, no Wikipedia entry is a static entry, because public knowledge is changing all the time. There's a certain irony that the folks drawn to NFTs, possibly a means to give independent artists a fair shot, are also driven to ridicule, critique, and manipulate a free, public encyclopedia that anyone can edit.

At the end of the day, it's worth remembering that Wikipedia isn't an arbiter of knowledge or a source of breaking news, even though it's sometimes read that way. It's just a bunch of weirdos paraphrasing secondary sources to the best of their ability. Since being drawn back into the honeypot that is Wikipedia editing, I've published a [new article](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciel_(musician)>) and have a couple more in their draft stages. I'd encourage more folks to sign up, start editing, and come hang out with me on talk pages.
