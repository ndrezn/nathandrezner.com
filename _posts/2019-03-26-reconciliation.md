title: Reconciliation in Chaos
---

<p>In Fall 2018, I wrote a paper based around sentiment analysis I conducted on a play, Judith Thompson's <i>Palace of the End</i>. The paper was published by <i>The Channel</i>, the McGill Department of English Undergraduate Review in March 2019.</p>

<p>The paper is available <a target="_blank" href = "http://mcgillchannelundergraduatereview.com/2019/03/reconciliation-in-chaos-tracing-word-distributions-and-sentiment-in-the-monologues-of-palace-of-the-end/">here</a>, and the source code and dataset is available <a href = "https://github.com/ndrezn/palace-of-the-end">here</a>.</p>
