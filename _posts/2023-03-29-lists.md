title: An archive of music lists
---

I published a few months ago my music list for 2022, and so they're preserved better, I also wanted to capture my lists from 2020 and 2021. Take a read, go listen to some of these tunes, and hopefully you feel inspired to buy some on Bandcamp or see some live. (Or, even better, you've also listened to plenty of these artists and are just as excited about them as I am.)

Enjoy, jam out, go dancing üíÉ.

So much good music in 2020. A few of my favorites were Kelly Lee Owens' _Inner Song_, which has wonderful melodies, great vocals from John Cale, and pairings of both ambient and dance; Taylor Swift's _folklore_, which I listened to basically on repeat all Fall; Ana Roxanne's _Because of a Flower_; and Moodymann's _Taken Away_, which gave me the dance tunes I needed while I sat still in my apartment.

2021 also was full of great records: I was jamming out to Kaytranada's _Intimidated_ (basically on loop); Anz's _All Hours_ with its incredible single "You Could Be"; Arlo Parks' _Collapsed In Sunbeams_ (whom I was lucky enough to see live opening for Florence + the Machine), and Low's _Hey What_, which continues to blow my mind every time I listen to it (do yourself a favor and watch the visuals).
