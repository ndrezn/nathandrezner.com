	<p>I'm involved in several research projects at McGill, all of which are ongoing.</p><br><br>

	<h2>Wikipedia</h2>
	<p>Since Fall 2018, I've been involved in a research project studying the salient patterns of language and behavior on Wikipedia. This project has evolved over time from a language-driven study of argument on Wikipedia to a network analysis-driven study of user behavior on Wikipedia.</p>

	<p>The project is overseen by Profs. Andrew Piper and Richard Jean So as part of the <a target="_blank" href = "https://txtlab.org/">.txtLab</a> at McGill, and in Summer 2018 I was awarded an <a target="_blank" href = "https://www.mcgill.ca/arts-internships/research">ARIA</a> for my work on the project.</p>

	<p>More information on the project, as well as some preliminary findings, is available on <a target="_blank" href = "https://github.com/ndrezn/txtLab/">GitHub</a>.</p><br><br>


	<h2>Computational Linguistics</h2>
	<p>Through the <a target="_blank" href = "https://mcqll.org/">McGill Computational & Quantitative Linguistics Lab</a>, I'm part of a research project studying productivity in language. I am working on reconstructing a qualitative model of productivity in an algorithmic representation to test its validity based on real-world productive patterns. More generally, the MCQLL studies fundamental questions about language acquisition, processing, use in society, and change over time.</p>
