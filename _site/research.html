	<p>I'm involved in several research projects at McGill, all of which are ongoing.<p><br><br>

	<h2>Wikipedia</h2>
	<p>Since Fall 2018, I've been involved in a research project studying the salient patterns of language and behavior on Wikipedia. This project has evolved over time from a language-driven study of argument on Wikipedia to a network analysis-driven study of user behavior on Wikipedia.</p>

	<p>The project is overseen by Profs. Andrew Piper and Richard Jean So as part of the <a target="_blank" href = "https://txtlab.org/">.txtLab</a> at McGill, and in Summer 2018 I was awarded an <a target="_blank" href = "https://www.mcgill.ca/arts-internships/research">ARIA</a> for my work on the project.</p>

	<p>More information on the project, as well as some preliminary findings, is available on <a target="_blank" href = "https://github.com/ndrezn/txtLab/">GitHub</a>.</p><br><br>

	<h2>The Riddle Project</h2>
	<p>I conduct development work and lead the digital humanities side of <a target="_blank" href = "https://riddleproject.github.io/">The Riddle Project</a>, an ROAAr project dedicated to transcribing, solving, and researching riddles in early manuscripts. The project is overseen by Prof. Nathalie Cooke. It takes a bit of a primer to understand exactly what The Riddle Project is about, but generally speaking it's a study of a specific genre of riddles which originated in the 19th century.</p>

	<p>For more, I would recommend looking into the website linked above, which among other things includes several interactive maps which illuminate some of the project's findings from the massive dataset of riddles collected by the project.</p><br><br>

	<h2>Computational Linguistics</h2>
	<p>Through the <a target="_blank" href = "https://mcqll.org/">McGill Computational & Quantitative Linguistics Lab</a>, I'm part of a research project studying productivity in language. I am working on reconstructing a qualitative model of productivity in an algorithmic representation to test its validity based on real-world productive patterns. More generally, the MCQLL studies fundamental questions about language acquisition, processing, use in society, and change over time.</p>
