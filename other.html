		<p>I have several side projects, with more on the way.</p><br><br>

		<h5>January 21, 2020</h5>
		<h2>Instagram Bots</h2>
		<p>Over the course of 2019, I built and deployed two Instagram bots, <a target="_blank" href = "https://www.instagram.com/wikipictureoftheday/">@wikipictureoftheday</a> and <a target="_blank" href = "https://www.instagram.com/wacky_minions/">@wacky_minions</a>. @wikipictureoftheday had a relatively simple concept: Pull the <a target="_blank" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Picture_of_the_day">Wikipedia picture of the day</a> and post it to Instagram at regular intervals. It ended up making a pretty compelling feed, with plenty of interesting facts and photography, but never took off in popularity.</p>

		<h5>November 23, 2019</h5>
		<h2><i>secretgroup.xyz</i></h2>
		<p>I organize and curate an art and design collective in Montreal called <i>secretgroup</i>, based around a series of spontaneous events and art spaces. More information on the collective, and the events we host, is available on our website at <a target="_blank" href = "https://secretgroup.xyz">secretgroup.xyz</a>.</p>

		<h5>April 3, 2019</h5>
		<h2>Horror Social Networks</h2>
		<p>To help identify and analyze the themes, tropes, and structure of horror, I created a set of graphs representing the social networks of various films and used network analysis to help clarify the role of the female gothic in social structure and identify the relationship between theatricality and role-playing in the horror genre.</p>

		<p>The source code, as well as a brief essay on my findings from the project, is available <a target="_blank" href = "https://github.com/ndrezn/horror-social-networks">here</a>.</p>

		<h5>March 26, 2019</h5>
		<h2>Reconciliation in Chaos</h2>
		<p>In Fall 2018, I wrote a paper based around sentiment analysis I conducted on a play, Judith Thompson's <i>Palace of the End</i>. The paper was published by <i>The Channel</i>, the McGill Department of English Undergraduate Review in March 2019.</p>

		<p>The paper is available <a target="_blank" href = "http://mcgillchannelundergraduatereview.com/2019/03/reconciliation-in-chaos-tracing-word-distributions-and-sentiment-in-the-monologues-of-palace-of-the-end/">here</a>, and the source code and dataset is available <a href = "https://github.com/ndrezn/palace-of-the-end">here</a>.</p>
